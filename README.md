# Iris Data Analysis

This is a simple Python project to learn how to use **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** for data analysis and visualization. We use the popular **Iris dataset** which contains flower measurements.

---

## ✅ What This Project Does

- Loads the Iris dataset using Python.
- Shows the first few rows to understand the data.
- Checks for missing values and data types.
- Calculates basic stats like average and standard deviation.
- Groups the data by flower species.
- Makes 4 different charts to visualize the data.

## 📊 Charts Created

1. **Line Chart** – Shows sepal length across samples.
2. **Bar Chart** – Compares petal length for each species.
3. **Histogram** – Shows how sepal width is distributed.
4. **Scatter Plot** – Compares sepal and petal length.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (for the dataset)
